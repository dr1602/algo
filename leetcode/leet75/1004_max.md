# Sliding Window

## 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given a binary array **nums** and an integer **k**, return the *maximum number of consecutive* **1's** *in the array if you can flip at most* **k'0s**.

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0,_1,1,1,1,1,1_]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

### Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** [0,0,_1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1_,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

### Constraints:

* **1 <= nums.length <= 105**
* **nums[i]** is either **0** or **1**.
* **0 <= k <= nums.length**

### Ideas to solve the problem:

- I can run through the entire array, to look for the longest number of consecutive 1.  
- When it is found, i must have a way to look for:
a. a zero before
b. a zero after
c. two zeros before
d. two zeros after

and change those zeros, as that would be the longest array.
--- i think this could be the most complex part: detect the zeros.
--- as the detecting the longest number of 1s is easy.

Before solving how to detect the zeros, we must understand the complexity

The complexity here would be at least linear, because we must run over the array at least once!

But that may not be necessary, given that we don't have restrictions, we can know the length before hand of the array, and we don't have to run all over if we
1. know the length of the ignored values
2. the current length of the longest array with 1s and 0s
3. the length of the original array or the remaining values to iterate.

... why?
Because with this there is no need to run on the entire array, you can stop when sum of **length of ignored values** + **length of current selection** > **length of the original array**

is it necessary to know the length and position of the current selection?
and what about the lengh of ignored values? <- maybe only the length because they become ignored when their length is:

**length of ignored values** < **length of current selection**

another thing, we cannot ignor k... as I think, the number of *k* most be included in: **length of current selection**.

```py

def longestOnes(nums, k):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :type k: int
    :rtype: int
    """

    ignored = []
    current = []

    while len_ignored + len_current < len(nums):
        position = 0
        zeros = 0

        if nums[position] == 0 and zeros < k or nums[position] == 1:
            current.append()


```

```
def longestOnes(nums, k):
    left = 0
    right = 0
    zeros = 0
    max_length = 0

    while right < len(nums):
        if nums[right] == 0:
            zeros += 1
        if zeros > k:
            if nums[left] == 0:
                zeros -= 1
            left += 1
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        right += 1

    return max_length

```

### Explanation

*Initialization:*
* **left** and **right** are pointers initially set to 0.
* **zeros** keeps track of the current number of 0's within the sliding window.
* **max_length** stores the maximum number of conecutive 1's found so far.

*Sliding Window*
* The **while** loop iterates through the array, expanding the pointer **right** as long as the number of 0's within the window is less than or equal to **k**.
* If the number of 0's exceeds **k**, the **left** pointer moved to the right until the window contains at most **k** 0's.
* The **max_length** is updated if the current window size is greater tha the previous maximum.

*Return*
* The funciton return the **max_length**, which represents the maximum number of consecutive 1's achievable by flipping at most **k** 0's.

Complexity Analysis
* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: O(1)

Key Points:
* The sliding window technique effiently tracks the maximum number of consecutive 1's while ensuring the constraint of flipping at most **k** 0's.
* The use of **zeros** to count the number of 0's within the window avoids unnecessary calculations.
* The **max_length** variable keeps track of the maximum length found so far.

This solution provides a clear and concise implementation of the **longestOnes** function, addressing the prompt effectively.
