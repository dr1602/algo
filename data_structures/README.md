# Common Data Strucutres: Explanations and Examples

## Arrays

An aaray is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed directly by its index.

[Example](1_array.py)

## Linked Lists

A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence

[Example](two_linked_list.py)

## Stacks

A stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. Elements are added to the top of the stack and removed from the top

[Example](three_stacks.py)

## Queues

A queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure. Elements are added to the back and removed from the front

[Example](four_queues.py)

## Sets

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

[Example](five_sets.py)

## Maps (Dictionaries in python)

A map (or dictionary) is a collection of key-value pairs

[Example](six_maps.py)

## Binary Trees

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

[Example](seven_binary_trees.py)

## Heaps

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.

[Example](eight_heaps.py)

## Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are somtimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

Example: Python using a dictionary to represent and adjacency list
