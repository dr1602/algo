# Algo

## Sorting

Sorgin algo arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Here are two common sorting algos.

### Bubble Sort

a. Explanation: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Repeats this process until de list is sorted.
b. Time complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case

[Example](bubble_sort.py)

### Merge Sort

a. Explanation: Divides the list into halves, sorts each half recusively, and then merges the sorted halves.
b. Time complexity: O(n log n) in al cases

[Example](merge_sort.py)

## Searching

Searching algorithms find the position of a specific element in a list.

### Linear Search

a. Explanation: Iterates through the list sequentially until the element is found or the end is reached
b. Time complexity: O(n) in the worst case
