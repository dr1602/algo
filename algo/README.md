# Algo

## Sorting

Sorgin algo arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Here are two common sorting algos.

### Bubble Sort

a. Explanation: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Repeats this process until de list is sorted.
b. Time complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case

[Example](bubble_sort.py)

## Merge Sort

a. Explanation: Divides the list into halves, sorts each half recusively, and then merges the sorted halves.
b. Time complexity: O(n log n) in al cases
